Instructions on how to update package (since you never remember how)

Ensure latest version of setuptools, wheel and twine are installed:
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

In same directory as setup.py, run:
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

To upload package to PyPi index (do this from parent dir of dist dir):
    twine upload dist/*

If you want to upload to TestPyPi then do 
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
